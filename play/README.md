**Learning objective:** By the end of this section, students will understand how to effectively organize and sequence game logic within a central function. They will learn to integrate individual functions to create a sequential gameplay progression triggered by a user's action, specifically by executing multiple functions in response to a single event.

## `play`

> ðŸ¥… Goal: contain and organize our game logic

Finally, we have all of the functions necessary to make our game work! Letâ€™s make sure they are all being used, and called upon in the correct order in our `play` function. Reminder- `play` is the function called when the user initiates game play by clicking Paper, Rock, or Scissors.

```js
const play = (event) => {
  getPlayerChoice(event);  // captures player choice, updates state
  getComputerChoice();  // randomly selects computers choice, updates state
  compare();            // determines winning result
  render();             // renders result message back to the user 
};
```

Let's review! It might be useful to take another look at our event listeners. We pass our `play` function to the event listeners on our rock paper scissors buttons, so that whenever a player clicks one, each of the functions invoked in `play` will run sequentially, updating state variables and rendering the changes back for the player to see.

Now that the `play` function is fully built out, its easier to see how this long chain of functionality is triggered by a single click!

```js
/*----------------------------- Event Listeners -----------------------------*/

document.querySelector('#rock').addEventListener('click', play);
document.querySelector('#paper').addEventListener('click', play);
document.querySelector('#scissors').addEventListener('click', play);
```
