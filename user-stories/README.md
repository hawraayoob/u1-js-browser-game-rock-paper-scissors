**Learning objective:** Students will review the user stories that will drive the planning and design of our Rock Paper Scissors game.

In this lesson, we will build a refined Rock, Paper, Scissors game incorporating the web technologies and techniques youâ€™ve worked with thus far:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- DOM Manipulation

## User stories

We've provided some user stories to help inform the design of this application:

- As a user, I want to see a landing page when I arrive at the website, so I know I'm in the right place.
- As a user, I want to see clearly labeled buttons for "Rock", "Paper", and "Scissors", on the landing page, so I instantly know my options for game play.
- As a user, I want to be able to click on one of the "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors" buttons, making it easy to select my game move.
- As a user, I want visual feedback after making my selection, so I know my choice has been registered.
- As a user, I want to see the computer's choice displayed next to mine, so I can compare the two.
- As a user, I want to be presented with a clear message indicating the winner of the game, so that I can immediately understand the outcome.
- As a user, I want the option to play another round, so I can try to improve my record.

Each of these stories addresses a specific aspect of the user experience, making it easier to manage the development of these features as pseudocode.
