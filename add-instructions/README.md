**Learning objective:** By the end of this lesson students will add gameplay instructions to their application to improve the user experience.

## How do I play?

Clear instructions are essential for browser games to ensure players understand the mechanics of how to play.
Without them, users may become frustrated or lose interest, leading to decreased engagement and eventual abandonment.

In developing a game application, never assume prior knowledge, even for universally recognized games like rock, paper, scissors. Remember, users span diverse backgrounds and cultures. Ensure the user experience is inclusive and intuitive for everyone.

## Add some instructions

1) Choose a place in your HTMl to add instructions.

2) Style this text to match the UI of the rest of the application.
